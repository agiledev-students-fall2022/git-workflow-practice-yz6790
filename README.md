# A Website I Found Interesting
This is a website I want to share. [Codecademy-Front_End](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/front-end-engineer-career-path)<br>

# Reason
[Codecademy-Front_End](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/front-end-engineer-career-path) is where I learned front-end technologies from. It is fun to learn a new programming language through practicing it, and this website makes it happen.
<p>
Also it covers most of the front-end knowledge. A beautiful page will come up step by step with the skills you learned.

The website is quite useful to me as well! One huge advantage is that it provides you with a learning path with selected tech stacks and gives the opportunities of practicing in the projects. Besides, the pricing seems relatively resonable correpsonding to the contents offered. I'll definitely try this.
